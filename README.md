Before using our solution, it is necessary to properly build the turtlebot3 example (build_dep.sh), to do that we provide a shell script, but it asssumes that the use already has a properly installed version of ROS2 Iron and Gazeebo, for further instructions refer to [Gazebo Tutorial](https://classic.gazebosim.org/tutorials?tut=ros2_installing&cat=connect_ros).

1. Then you can run ./setup.sh to setup the python3 environment

2. Launch gazebo with ./launch_gazebo.sh

3. Launch detection by running ./launch_detection.sh
